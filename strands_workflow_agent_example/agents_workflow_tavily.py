# Agentic Workflow: Research Assistant

This example demonstrates an agentic workflow using Strands agents with web research capabilities.

## Key Features
- Specialized agent roles working in sequence
- Direct passing of information between workflow stages
- Web research using http_request and retrieve tools
- Fact-checking and information synthesis

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the example directory
2. Run: python research_assistant.py
3. Enter queries or claims at the prompt

## Example Queries
- "Thomas Edison invented the light bulb"
- "Tuesday comes before Monday in the week"

## Workflow Process
1. Researcher Agent: Gathers web information using multiple tools
2. Analyst Agent: Verifies facts and synthesizes findings
3. Writer Agent: Creates final report

If a Exa API key is provided, this agent will use Exa for web search.
Otherwise, it will check for a Tavily API key for performing a web search with Tavily.
If neither key is present, the agent will fall back to a web search with Duck Duck Go, that does not require an API key
